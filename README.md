As I Graphic Designer and Web Developer, I created a portfolio page to show potential employers my experience and samples of my work.

When the employer loads my site, it shows my name and Illustration. Nav bar links to About Me, Artwork samples, Resume and how to contact me. When the link buttons are clicked they scroll to the specific section.
This is a responsive site. Therefore, if the page is viewed in a mobile device, all the elements will arrange to all sizes.

This is the live view of my portfolio page deployed via GitHub: https://uanq2.github.io/Uriel-Portfolio/
